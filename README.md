# reading-system-testing
Reading-System-Testing is a repository used by the Reading System/App testing working group. We do accessibility testing of reading systems and provide feedback to RS developers and Assistive Technology Developers. We expect the issue tracking functions will help us as we notify developers of specific bugs we have encountered and replicated.
